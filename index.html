                <h2>Short-Term Impact</h2>
                <p>The act desegregated public facilities and schools. The Equal Employment Oppportunity Commission was created to regulated employment and workplace. Voting rights were improved which increased voter participation, allowing minorities such as African Americans to become more active in politics. It also led to opposition, especially in the south, which led to the act slowly being enforced.</p>

                <h2>Long-Term Impact</h2>
                <p>The civil rights act led to other legislation such as the Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act. It also increased economic mobility for African Americans which led to lower economic inequality. It also made the labor market more efficient by increasing the employment of minorities. This led to individuals that were more qualified, that previously could not enter the workforce, to contibute to the economy.</p>
